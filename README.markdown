YUI Compass Plugin
------------------

This plugin implements the YUI CSS framework in Sass for use with the Compass Authoring Framework.

To install, unpack this folder into your project's extension folder.

You can do this by downloading the zip/tar.gz file for this project or by checking it out from git.

Your project's extension folder is configurable, but by default it is the `extensions` subfolder within your stand alone project. For rails projects it defaults to `vendor/plugins/compass/extensions`.

After unpacking, you should rename the folder from `yui-compass-plugin` to just `yui`.
